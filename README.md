# README

This project is a starter kit for Rails 8 + Vite + React + TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui.

In this project, you can design pages using the conventional Rails approach with friendly SSR (server-side rendering), or you can build complex user interfaces using React, driven by react-router-dom for client-side routing.

## Environment

- Ruby 3.3.4
- Rails 8.0 edge
- Node.js 20.x

```
bin/setup
